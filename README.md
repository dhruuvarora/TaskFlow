### 🛠️ Recommended for Production

For the best production performance, add a build bundler plugin such as:
- [`@snowpack/plugin-webpack`](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack)
- [`snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle`](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle)

To integrate, modify the `snowpack.config.mjs` file accordingly.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What about ejecting?

**No eject needed!** Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA follows the same philosophy. You can freely customize your setup without any constraints.
